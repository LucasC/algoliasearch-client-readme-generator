 1. In you project, open the "Package Manager Console" (Tools → Library Package Manager → Package Manager Console)
 2. Enter `Install-Package Algolia.Search` in the Package Manager Console
 3. Initialize the client with your ApplicationID and API-Key. You can find all of them on [your Algolia account](http://www.algolia.com/users/edit).

```
